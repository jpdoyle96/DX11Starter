Textures README

Implemented a Specular map for the textures. Used the inverse of the specular map for each pixel (so if a pixel had a roughness of 1 it had no reflection, and a roughness of 0 had a strong reflection). 

Most evident when looking at the wood planks vs the dirt/grout between them. The wood is much more reflective.
